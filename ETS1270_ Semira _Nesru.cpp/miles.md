## THE PSEUDO-CODE

* start
  
* declare the  input (the tank capacity, the miles that the car can go per gallon, total miles traveled by the car)
  
* accpet the input (the tank capacity, the miles that the car can go per gallon, total miles traveled by the car)
  
* calculate the total miles that the car can travel without refueling as total_miles= tank capacity * miles_traveled_per_gallon
   
* print the miles that the car can travel with out refueling

* end
