   ## The pseudocode: 

* Start the program
 
* Global variables:
  
* row = 4: Indicates the total number of rows present in the grid.
  
* maxColumns = 8: Specifies the limits of the columnsâ€™ maximum count.
  
* grid[row][maxColumns]: This is where the grid values are stored as a 2 dimensional array.
  
* revealed[row][maxColumns] = {false}: This keeps the record of the cards coming up - that have been revealed.
  
* MatchFound = false: Keeps history of at least one match that has been made.
  
* Function shuffle(column):
  
* Use the current time to set up the random number generator.
  
* For every cell in the grid, do the following:
 
   - Set up row and column value of the current cell.
   
   - Create a random index for a cell to swap with.
   
   - Pick the element in the current cell and replace it with the element in the cell that was randomly picked.
