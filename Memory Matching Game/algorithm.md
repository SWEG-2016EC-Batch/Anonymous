   ## The pseudocode: 

* Start the program
 
* Global variables:
  
* row = 4: Indicates the total number of rows present in the grid.
  
* maxColumns = 8: Specifies the limits of the columnsâ€™ maximum count.
  
* grid[row][maxColumns]: This is where the grid values are stored as a 2 dimensional array.
  
* revealed[row][maxColumns] = {false}: This keeps the record of the cards coming up - that have been revealed.
  
* MatchFound = false: Keeps history of at least one match that has been made.
  
* Function shuffle(column):
  
* Use the current time to set up the random number generator.
  
* For every cell in the grid, do the following:
 
   - Set up row and column value of the current cell.
   
   - Create a random index for a cell to swap with.
   
   - Pick the element in the current cell and replace it with the element in the cell that was randomly picked.
     
* main program:
* declare variables:
   - n: user decision to stop or continue (input)
   - column: number of columns based on difficulty (int)
   -counter: number of rounds played (int)
   - win: number of successful matches (int)
   - lose: number of unsuccessful attempts (int)

* start do-while loop for multiple rounds:
    * Display Menu with difficulty options:
        1. Level 1 (4 columns)
        2. Level 2 (6 columns)
        3. Level 3 (8 columns)
        
    * Get the user input for difficulty level (1, 2, or 3)
    * if input is invalid:
        * clear screen
        * ask user to input again
    
    * Set `column` based on selected level (4 for level 1, 6 for level 2, 8 for level 3)

    * Initialize Grid:
        - Grid consists of pairs of numbers
        - Shuffle grid using shuffle(column) function

â€¢Game Loop:

*To initiate the round set gameover = false.

*As gameover is not yet set the round is still active.

*Show the user the current state of the grid:

*Display the revealed numbers.

*All unrevealed numbers should be hidden behind an asterisk (*).

â€¢ Receive User Input:

*ask for the row and the column of the first card.

*ask for the row and the column of the second card.

*The input values must be verified for boundaries, including the indices.

*If a user calls a card twice, the system must ask him to input again.

*If the card has already been selected the user must be informed and put the input prompts such card  again.
