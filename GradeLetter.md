## Pseudo code  
step 1: start  
step 2: read inputs 
  - test 
  - quiz
  - project
  - final  
  - assignment

step 3: check if each inputs are correct, if not goto step 2 and if the are correct, then goto step 4.  
step 4: check if the inputs are valid, if they are, then goto step 5 and if they are not valid, then goto step 2.  
step 5: calculate mark as mark = test + quiz + project + final + assignment.  
step 6: determine the grade letter as  

    6.1 if mark is greater than or equal to 90, then grade letter is A+  
    6.2 if mark is between 90 and 80, then grade letter is A
    6.3 if mark is between 80 and 75, then grade letter is B+
    6.4 if mark is between 75 and 60, then grade letter is B 
    6.5 if mark is between 60 and 55, then grade letter is C+ 
    6.6 if mark is between 55 and 45, then grade letter is C 
    6.7 if mark is between 45 and 30, then grade letter is D 
    6.8 if mark is less than 30, then grade leter is F  
step 7: print grade letter  
step 8: end
