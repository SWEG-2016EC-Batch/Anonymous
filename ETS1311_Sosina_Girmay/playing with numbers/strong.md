## pseudo code  
step 1: start  

step 2: read input  
- number  
- sum  
     
step 3: check if the input is valid or not. If it is, then goto 
step 4. If it is not valid, then goto step 2  

step 4: calculate the remainder as remainder = number % 10  

step 5: update the number as number = number / 10  

step 6: find the factorial to the remainder    

step 7: add the factorial of the remainder to sum  

step 8: repeate these step until number becomes 0  

step 9: check if sum is the same as the number  

step 10: if they are the same then print the number is strong and if they are not the same, then print the number is not strong.   

step 11: end
