## pseudo code  
step 1: start  

step 2: read input  
- number  

step 3: check if the input is valid or not. If it is valid, then goto step 4. If it is not valid then goto step 2  

step 4: find all the divisors of a number including itself   

step 5: find the sum of all the divisors  

step 6: subtract the number from sum as sum = sum - number  

step 7: check whether the sum and the number are the same  

step 8: if they are the same then print the number is a perfect number. if they are not the same, then print the number is not a perfect number   

step 9: end
