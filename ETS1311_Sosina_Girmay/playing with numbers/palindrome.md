## pseudo code  
step 1: start  

step 2: read input  
- number  
- temp 
- remainder 

step 3: check if the input is valid. if it is, then goto step 4. if it is not valid, then goto step 2  

step 4: calculate the remainder as remainder = number % 10  

step 5: calculate temp as temp = temp * 10 + remainder  

step 6: update the value of number as number = number / 10  

step 7: repeate these steps until number becomes 0  

step 8: print temp  

step 9: end
