## pseudo code  
step 1: start  

step 2: read input  
- number 
- counter   
  
step 3: check if the input is valid. if it is not, goto step 2. if it is valid, goto step 4  

step 4: update number as number = number / 10 until number becomes 0  

step 5: update counter as counter = counter + 1 for each update of number  

step 6: print counter since it is the same as the number of digits of the number  

step 7: end
