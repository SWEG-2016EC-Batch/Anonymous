## pseudo code  
step 1: start  

step 2: read input  
- number  

step 3: check if the input is valid. If it is not, then goto step 2. And if it is valid, then goto step 4.   

step 4: calculate remainder as remainder = number % 10  

step 5: add remainder to reverse  

step 6: update the value of the number as number = number / 10  

step 7: check if the number is 0. If it is, then the reverse of the number becomes reverse. But if number is not 0, then multiply reverse by 10 and repeate the steps starting from step 4 until the number becomes 0.  

step 8: print reverse of the number   

step 9: end
