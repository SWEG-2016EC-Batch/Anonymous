## Pseudo code  
step 1: start  

step 2: read input number  

step 3: check if the input is valid. if it is, then goto step 4 and if it is not valid goto step 2  

step 4: calculate the remainder as remainder = number % 10  until number becomes 0

step 5: if remainder is even, then calculate the product as product = product *remainder. if it is not, continue to the next remainder   

step 6: update the value of number as number = number / 10   

step 7: print product  

step 8: end
