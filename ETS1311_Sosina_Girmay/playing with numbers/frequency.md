## pseudo code  
step 1: start  

step 2: read inputs  
- number  
- frequency as an array 

step 3: check if the input is valid. if it is, then goto step 4. if it is not valid goto step 2  

step 4: find each digit as digit = number % 10   

step 5: for each digit increase its frequency by 1  

step 6: update the value of the number as number = number / 10  

step 7: repeate these steps until number becomes 0  

step 8: print all the digits frequency   

step 9: end
