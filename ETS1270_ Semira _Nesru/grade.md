##Pseudo-code

 * START
   
 * DECLARE variables accept inputs( test, quiz, project, assignment, final_exam, mark as float.)
   
 * CALCULATE mark = test + quiz + project + assignment + final_exam

 * if mark >= 90 THEN
       PRINT "Your grade is 'A+'"
   
   else if mark >= 80 THEN
       PRINT "Your grade is 'A'"
   
   else if mark >= 75 THEN
       PRINT "Your grade is 'B+'"
   
   else if mark >= 60 THEN
       PRINT "Your grade is 'B'"
   
   else if mark >= 55 THEN
       PRINT "Your grade is 'C+'"
   
   else if mark >= 45 THEN
       PRINT "Your grade is 'C'"
   
   else if mark >= 30 THEN
       PRINT "Your grade is 'D'"
   
   else
       PRINT "Your grade is 'F'"
