Algorithm

1. Start

2. Initialize Variables

   • choice (to hold user decision to continue)

   • number (to hold the user's choice of pattern)

3. Display Menu

   • Print the title "* MENU *"

   • Print options for patterns (1 to 12)

4. Input User Choice

   • Prompt user to "Please enter number to choose the patterns: "

   • Read number

5. Validate User Input

   • While number is not between 1 and 12:

     • Prompt user to "Please enter a valid number from the menu (1-12): "

     • Read number

6. Execute Pattern Based on User Choice

   • Use a switch-case structure:

     • Case 1: Call five_num_five_times()

     • Case 2: Call alphabets_upto_x()

     • Case 3: Call num_half_pyramid_left()

     • Case 4: Call num_half_pyramid_right()

     • Case 5: Call alphabets_half_pyramid()

     • Case 6: Call five_alphabets_five_times()

     • Case 7: Call hollow_rectangle()

     • Case 8: Call inverted_half_pyramid()

     • Case 9: Call hollow_inverted_half_pyramid() (not defined in your code)

     • Case 10: Call full_pyramid() (not defined in your code)

     • Case 11: Call inverted_full_pyramid() (not defined in your code)

     • Case 12: Call hollow_pyramid() (not defined in your code)

7. Ask User to Continue

   • Prompt user with "Would you like to see more patterns? (0 / 1): "

   • Read choice

8. Repeat Steps 4-7 Until User Chooses Not to Continue

   • Continue looping until choice is not equal to 1

9. Display Exit Message

   • Print "Goodbye! :("

10. End

Pattern Functions

For each of the pattern functions, the following logic applies:

• fivenumfive_times(): Print numbers from 1 to 5, five times.

• alphabetsuptox(): Print alphabets from A to X, inserting a newline after every 6 characters.

• numhalfpyramid_left(): Print a left-aligned half pyramid of numbers.

• numhalfpyramid_right(): Print a right-aligned half pyramid of numbers.

• alphabetshalfpyramid(): Print a half pyramid of alphabets.

• fivealphabetsfive_times(): Print "a, b, c, d, e" five times.

• hollow_rectangle(): Print a hollow rectangle made of asterisks.

• invertedhalfpyramid(): Print an inverted half pyramid of asterisks.

• Additional pattern functions (hollow inverted half pyramid, full pyramid, inverted full pyramid, hollow pyramid) need to be defined as per requirements.
